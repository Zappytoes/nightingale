Setting SAVE_WEIGHTS_INTE = 1000 will cause training to end more quickly for purposes of this tutorial. For training the model with a complete dataset (i.e, hundreds or thousands of images and annotations) it is recomended that SAVE_WEIGHTS_INTE be set to a value in the range of tens of thousands (e.g., 10000, 20000, 50000 etc), but training iterations are another hyperparameter to play with. \n",
