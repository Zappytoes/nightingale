# <span style='color:purple'>Welcome to Nightingale v0.1! 


## <span style='color:Blue'>Nightingale is a Python & Tensorflow codebase for training, exporting, inferencing, & evaluating the state-of-the-art SCRDet++ object detection model with ResNet backbone on NITF imagery. Nightingale's inference module is compatible with the OMITTED suite of products. The current version of Nightingale is configured for system single channel imagery.  
    
# <span style='color:Blue'> Some exciting features of <span style='color:purple'>*Nightingale*</span> include:

* ## <span style='color:Blue'> A pre-configured Tensorflow-GPU anaconda environment or Docker container
* ## <span style='color:Blue'> State-of-the-art detector performance for Object-Aligned Bounding-Boxes (OAB) with the SCRDet++ model
* ## <span style='color:Blue'> Easy-to-follow model training & inference guides with Jupyter Notebooks
* ## <span style='color:Blue'> An updated training pipeline for NITFs, with background-only (i.e., annotation-free) image support for enhanced False Positive reduction
* ## <span style='color:Blue'> A module for quickly exporting trained models to a deployable Tensorflow frozen-graph format
* ## <span style='color:Blue'> An intuitive inference API with OMITTED-compatible I/O
* ## <span style='color:Blue'> A fast & powerful inference module for processing large NITFs using a parallel-gpu image-tiling scheme
    
# <span style='color:purple'>Who should use Nightingale?

## <span style='color:Blue'>Nightingale is for Computer Vision data scientists, researchers, or developers with access to the Intelligence Community (IC) Common Operating Environment (COE). You'll need a linux style GPU-accelerated computing environemnt with Jupyter Notebooks, such as users with a Redmine RLE account and access to RLE's JupyterHub or DGX systems. It is also for those interestd in object-aligned object detection or a OMITTED-compatible detector.

# <span style='color:purple'>Getting started

# You'll need access to a linux style operating system with Jupyter Software (or similar IPython notebook interpreter) installed.

# Detailed instructions for getting set up and executing Nightingale with code and data examples are detailed in a series of Jupyter Notebooks contained in this repo. Open the "Welcome_To_Nightingale.ipynb" to get started.
